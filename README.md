# MacroKeyboard

A Project to learn some Python and getting used to a RaspberryPi Pico.

At the Moment there are just 2 Buttons. The first one is to Mute/Unmute on a Teamspeakserver (Keys: F7 and F9 for the Hotkeys in Teamspeak)
and the second is for starting and joining ur selected Teamspeakserver on a Mac.

Iam still learning, i think there is much to improve :D
